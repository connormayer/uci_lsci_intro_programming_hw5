# Homework 5
The fifth homework assignment from LSCI 109: Introduction to Programming for Language Science

This homework consists of 3 problems, one in each of the following files:
* library.py
* question3.txt

The Python script has some code that you will need to fill in for the first two questions. 
Descriptions of each problem can be found in the PDF for this assignment on Canvas.

Instructions for how to submit your assignment can be found in the Lab 2 handout.

The tests folder contains the tests that will be used to grade your assignment. 
Do not modify these tests (your assignment will be flagged in the system if
you do), but feel free to look at them.

Remember that you can run the tests locally by running the `pytest` command.
